# StreamCounter

A simple C# Wpf application. Generates a txt file at launch or reads an existing one. Can add and subtract the value you want with either buttons on the application or key bindings control + "~1" "-+" and "numpad -+". It doesn't include negative values since I don't need them for my purpose. This will be changed in the future so it can be used as a death counter as well. 

Something like StreamCounter probably already exists but I couldn't find it. So I knew a little bit of c# wpf from editing an application that manipulates windows firewall rules. StreamCounter comes with the MIT license. Enjoy!
