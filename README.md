# StreamCounter

A simple C# Wpf application. Generates a txt file at launch or reads an existing one. Can add, subtract and reset the value you want with either buttons on the application or key bindings "control" + "~1" "-+" and "numpad -+". I haven't found a good binding for reset yet so it's noted off for now. StreamCounter doesn't include negative values since I don't need them for my current purpose. 

Something like StreamCounter probably already exists but I couldn't find it. So I know a little bit of c# wpf from editing an application that manipulates windows firewall rules. StreamCounter comes with the MIT license. This is more or less my first solo project posted to github and using c# Wpf. Enjoy!

StreamCounter is intended to be used with OBS. Create a text source and link it to the "xyz.txt" file generated at first launch.
